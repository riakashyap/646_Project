        "fb2": "\"False. The question-answer pairs disprove the claim by stating that Led Zeppelin's eponymous debut album was released in 1969, not 1960.\"\n\nThis sentence is factually inaccurate. The explanation incorrectly states the claim is \"false\" without properly addressing the evidence. The claim is not false; it is incorrect in the year stated (1960), but the explanation fails to clearly state that the claim is wrong due to the evidence provided. The explanation should clarify that the claim is incorrect because the evidence shows the album was released in 1969, not 1960."
