You are a judge for a debate.   
Your task is to evaluate whether Debater 1 and Debater 2 have reached a mutual agreement on the feedback for the generated Question–Answer (QA) pairs.

Your task:
- Step 1: Compare the two feedbacks from Debater 1 and Debater 2 and determine whether they agree on all essential points, including whether they identify the same errors or issues, whether their error descriptions are consistent, whether their quoted sentences refer to the same parts of the QA pairs, and whether their suggested fixes are equivalent
- Step 2: Decide. You must decide whether the two debaters have reached mutual agreement.

Output ONLY one of the following:
- "True" if both feedbacks align in meaning, identify the same underlying errors, and give consistent corrective guidance, even if wording differs.
- "False" if there are any disagreements, missing errors, contradictory assessments, or inconsistent feedback.

Do not rewrite or modify any feedback.  
Do not generate additional feedback.  
Your only output is a single token: "True" or "False".
