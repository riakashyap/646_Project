You are given an unverified statement and question-answer pairs regarding the claim that needs to be explored. You follow these steps:

Claim: {}
Question-Answer Pairs:
{}

Your task is to ask a followup question regarding the claim specifically based on the question answer pairs.

Never ask for sources or publishing.

The follow-up question must be descriptive, specific to the claim, and very short, brief, and concise.

The follow-up question should not appeal to video evidence not ask for calculations or methodology.

The followup question should not be seeking to answer a previously asked question. It can however attempt to improve that question.

You are not allowed to use the word "claim" or "statement". Instead if you want to refer to the claim/statement, you should point out the exact issue in the claim/statement that you are phrasing your question around.

Reply only with the followup question and nothing else.
