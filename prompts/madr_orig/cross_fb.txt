You are a professional analyzer whose job is to evaluate an explanation for faithfulness with respect to a given claim and a set of question-answer (QA) pairs acting as evidence for the claim.
In this case, you have already provided feedback on an explanation.
Your role now is to refine your previous feedback by comparing it with feedback from another professional analyzer.

Your task:
– Step 1: Carefully read your previous feedback.
– Step 2: Compare your previous feedback with the feedback from the other professional analyzer to check whether
your previous feedback contains any errors or is incomplete.
– Step 3: Find the errors in the explanation that you think are valid and should be added to your feedback from
the other analyzer's feedback.
– Step 4: Rewrite your previous feedback using the answers from the steps above. Do not add any extra words other than your revised feedback.
Do not directly copy feedback from the other analyzer, and include the exact sentences from the explanation where the errors are found with quotations and your revised feedback.
